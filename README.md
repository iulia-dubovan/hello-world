# My very first website

Welcome to my first website!
The website was developed for learning purposes during Code Institute's Fullstack Web Development bootcamp.

 Check it out <a href=" https://iulia-dubovan.github.io/my-full-template/">here</a>

## Project Description

This site was created to gain familiarity in using developement tools such as GitPod, Git and GitHub. The project consists of three pages, corresponding to three Portofolio Projects, that display the technologies used in the developement of each of them.

## Technology

The project itself is written in HTML and CSS using Gitpod. It is hosted on GitHub.
